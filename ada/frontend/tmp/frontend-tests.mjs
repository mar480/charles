 Concepts belong to hypercubes (tables). A hypercube (table) is a data structure made up of reportable concepts (rows) and available dimensions (columns). The UK taxonomies use closed hypercubes. This means that every line item concept belongs to at least one hypercube, and users cannot create their own taxonomy concepts.

 This tab shows the available dimensions (columns) as dropdown selectors. In this example, we can see that Property, Plant, and Equipment can be broken down by dimensions 6053 PPE Ownership and 6052 PPE Classes. 

 The contents of those dropdowns are the dimension's domain members. All of the other reportable concepts (rows) available in this hypercube are listed under "Primary Items".
